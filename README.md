# Interactive Paycard
I used the idea from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/du50op/reactinteractivepaycard/) but I did the project with Vanilla JS from scratch instead of React. 
The only thing I used from the original project was the background, chip, and logo images for the credit card. I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can make this with JS because the project is very cool.

I am open to any suggestions, help, and contribuions!
